# **void Keyword**
void is the **return type of the fucntion**.**Return type** means that when the function executes all the code inside,it should return this value. _void_ means there is no return value.

# **main() function**
The _main() function_ is a predefined method in dart.It is important and mendetory part.The method acts as the entry point for any dart application.The main function serves as the starting point for program execution. It usually controls program execution by directing the calls to other functions in the program.

# **What is Dart used for?**
  Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.

# **What is flutter?**
  Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

# **Why does flutter use it?**
  Dart makes it easier to create smooth animations and transitions that run at 60fps. Dart can do object allocation and garbage collection without locks. And like JavaScript, Dart avoids preemptive scheduling and shared memory (and thus locks).

# ** What is variable and Some rules + naming convention?
  A variable is a characteristic that can be measured and that can assume different values.
  The rules + naming convention for writting variables -
      1.Variable names are case sensitive (a and A are different).
      2.Variable name can consist of letters/number and alphabets.
      3.Variable name cannot start with number.
      4.Keywords are not allowed to use as a variable name.
      5.Blank spaces are not allowed in a variable name.
      6.Special characters are not allowed except for the underscore (_) and the dollar ($) symbol.
      
    Data types in Dart programming are given below:
      *Numbers
        1.integer
        2.double
      *Strings
      *Booleans
      *Lists
      *Maps

# **What is Constant?
  Constants are objects whose values cannot be changed during the execution of the program.

# **What is difference between "const" & "final"?
        i.Initialization difference.
        ii.Compile time difference.
        iii.Class/Instance level const variable is not possible.

# **What is Data Type and explaine different type of data types?
  A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.
