# **What is operators?
  Operands represents the data and operators represents how the operator will be processed.

# **Types of operators
        1.Arithmetic
        ##### Operator Symbol	       Operator Name
                +	                     Addition
                -	                     Subtraction
                -expr	                 Unary Minus (For reversing the  sign of the expression)
                *	                     Multiplication 
                /	                     Division (For dividing two operands and give output in double)
                ~/	                   Division (For dividing two operands and give output in integer)
                %	                     Modulus
        2.Assignment
        ##### Operator Symbol	       Operator Name
              =	                       Equal
              +=	                     Plus equal
              -=	                     Minus equal
              *=	                     Asterisk equal
              /=	                     Division equal
        3.Increment & decrement
        ##### Operator Symbol	       Operator Name
             ++	                       Increment
             --	                       Decrement
          Use case of pre-increment & decrement:
              ++variable
              --variable
          Use case of post-increment & decrement :
              variable++
              variable--
          
        4.Relational
        ##### Operator Symbol	       Operator Name
                 >	                   Greater than
                 <	                   Less than
                 >=	                   Greater than or equal to
                 <=	                   Less than or equal to
                 ==	                   Equal to
                 !=	                   Not equal to
        5.Logical
        ##### Operator Symbol	       Operator Name
                 &&	                      and
                 ||	                      or
                 !	                      not
        5.Type test operators
        ##### Operator Symbol	       Operator Name
                 is	                   is (Gives boolean value true if the object has a specific type)
                 is!	                 is not (Gives boolean value false if the object has a specific type)
