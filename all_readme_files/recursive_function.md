# *What is recursion 
    Recursion is any programming language means a function making a call itself.It is used to solve large complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.
    In a recursive function, the function calls itself repeatedly until a base condition is reached.
    The function basically has two parts.

        Recursive: The recursive part is called again and again with a smaller subproblem.
        Base: The base condition is checked every time a function call is made. If the function is in a base condition it is used to provide a solution.
